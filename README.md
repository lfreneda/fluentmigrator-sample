A fluentmigrator ( https://github.com/schambers/fluentmigrator ) sample

#### Getting started

##### Database creation

First of all, you have to create your database

##### Edit .bat's scripts under tools/ folder

After created the database, you must edit migrate_up.bat and migrate_down.bat to set the correct connectionstring :)

That's it
